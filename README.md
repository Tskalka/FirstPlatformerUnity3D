# Overview

This is a basic template for a 3D platformer in Unity. This was to further my learning by appling my knowledge of C# in the Unity enviornment.

In this short game template, you can move or, sprint by pressing "q", in every direction, and jump around a terrain with trees and mountains. 

This was created so I could learn the Unity environment and associated libraries in C# and Visual Studio.
