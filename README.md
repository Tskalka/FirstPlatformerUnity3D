# Overview

This is a basic template for a 3D platformer in Unity. This was to further my learning by appling my knowledge of C# in the Unity enviornment.

In this short game template, you can move in every direction, and jump on small platforms located around the scence.

This was created so I could learn the Unity environment and associated libraries in C# and Visual Studio.
